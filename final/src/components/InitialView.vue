                                            <p>This project is for making a website which can show the usage of metro bike. There will be two parts in the website. 
                                            One part is the general information contains the borrow and return rate for all 4 areas and the other part is focusing on details for one chosen station.</p>
                                            <p>The Metro Bike Share system features approximately 1,400 bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Port of LA and Venice. 
                                                Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips and to get to transit on your schedule. 
                                                Metro Bike Share is an additional public transportation option for Angelenos and visitors to get around. It is fast, fun and affordable!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The Metro Bike Share station network provides about twice as many bike parking spaces —&nbsp;or what we refer to as “dock points” —&nbsp;
                                                as there are bikes. This maximizes available bike share parking when you arrive to your destination station. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Metro Bike Share is the fast, easy, and fun way to ride, anytime. 
                                                Get a bike from any Metro Bike Share station, go for a ride, and give it back at any station. It’s easy — just like riding a bike!</p>
